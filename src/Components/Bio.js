      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I recently graduated from the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy.
        Before my shift into software engineering, I was an apparel designer for
        15 years, focused primarily on mass market menswear and print design.
        When I decided to make a career change last year I originally considered
        data visualization design but I ended up enjoying the programming part
        of that so much that I decided to become a software engineer instead!
      </p>
      <p>
        My past jobs gave me experience with managing complex projects from
        conception through delivery, communicating clearly with people from a
        wide range of backgrounds and across language and timezone barriers, and
        a desire to use new tools and software to work more efficiently. I enjoy
        using my creative and problem-solving skills to build beautiful and
        user-friendly web applications. I am looking forward to becoming a
        front-end or full stack engineer within a company that is working to
        make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I love knitting, hiking, bird-watching, spoiling my two
        cats, and forgetting mugs of tea around the house.
