      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer specializing in React, Node.js, Express, and
        PostgreSQL. I have 15 years of experience in the design industry where I
        focused primarily on mass market menswear and print design. I loved
        creating products for people to use in their everyday lives, and I felt
        it was time to move into an industry with more innovation and growth. As
        a seasoned designer, I bring an eye for aesthetics and the skills to
        communicate clearly with people from a wide range of backgrounds and
        across language and timezone barriers. During my training at Fullstack
        Academy's Grace Hopper Program I gained new experience learning exciting
        frameworks and computer science concepts, as well as the thrill of
        working with my teammates in an agile environment. I enjoy using my
        creative and problem-solving skills to build beautiful and user-friendly
        web applications, and I aim to work within companies that are working to
        make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I love hiking, knitting, bird-watching, spoiling my two
        cats, and forgetting mugs of tea around the house.
