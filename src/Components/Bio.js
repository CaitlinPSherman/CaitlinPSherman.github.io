      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I recently graduated from the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy.
        Before my shift into software engineering, I was an apparel designer for
        15 years, focused primarily on mass market menswear and print design. I
        loved creating products for people to use in their everyday lives, but I
        felt it was time for a change and wanted to move into an industry with
        more innovation and growth. I originally considered data visualization
        design but I ended up enjoying the programming part of that so much that
        I decided to become a software engineer instead!
      </p>

        My past jobs gave me experience with managing complex projects from
        conception through delivery; communicating clearly with people from a
        wide range of backgrounds and across language and timezone barriers; and
        a desire to use new tools and software to work more efficiently. At
        Grace Hopper I learned exciting new frameworks and computer science
        concepts, and the thrill of learning and working with my classmates in
        an agile environment. I enjoy using my creative and problem-solving
        skills to build beautiful and user-friendly web applications. I am
        looking forward to becoming a front-end or full stack engineer within a
        company that is working to make the world a better place.
      </p>

        In my spare time I love hiking, knitting, bird-watching, spoiling my two
        cats, and forgetting mugs of tea around the house.
